<div class="note note-yellow"><b>Update:</b> VGAPainter is planned to be revived and updated in the near future.</div>

VGAPainter is a 256-color bitmap editor primarily targeting VGA mode 13h.

It also supports custom palletes, importing and exporting to true colour formats and a binary bitmap format.

This was created as an experiment and means of generating visuals capable of display in MS-DOS.

But it can also be used in making pixel art for other systems as well.
