# What is the “Razza Suite”?

This is a collection of projects I've worked on over the years which I reckon other people can use, and usually put a bit more effort into.

At the moment, these are older projects I'm currently polishing up, or ones I've previously dropped and picked up again.

This website will be used for aggregating documentation of these projects, and hopefully promoting other project's I've worked on since.

My goal is to make as much of this as open source as possible, with some closed source releases to markets where that isn't possible (i.e. Microsoft Store, App Store, Google Play).

# Who is Razza?

Oh hi there! I'm a software developer working on a few side projects from time to time.
